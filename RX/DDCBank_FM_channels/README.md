### Record and FM demodulate multiples channels with squelch

This example requires registered license to enable DDCBank module !  

We will create two channels, then launch a listening task for both.  
Monitored frequencies are 156.5 & 156.8 (marine VHF channels 10 & 16)   

As result you will get FM demodulated wav files in `/tmp/` directory.
